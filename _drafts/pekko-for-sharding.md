Describe the work done for Ms365 IM connector.  

Explain how to mix Akka/Pekko framework with Spring. 

In a team that is Spring oriented, replacing Spring App with scala app that uses Pekko is a big, big and dengerous step.
The world that the team knows and is able to maintain and improve: our existing Spring app is well tested, we have experience with deployment and the team has been already contributing to it for many years. 
Assuming no previous experience of working with FP, without knowing best practices, rapid teleportation into an uknown world of FunctionalProgramming seems to be risky. 
Expectation of such a big step, are also high: the idea for moving from Spring to Scala with Akka/Pekko is not comming in our case from amtiotion, but is inspired by perfromance issues.
