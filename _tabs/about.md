Hello, this is my blog. 
Not sure what I will be putting here, but we are in era of social media, don't want to stay behind, so I already have a
Github account.  

I think I will be writing here news about:
* guacamole project -> kind of library on top of aws sdk, to interact with DynamoDB
* tortilla -> a set of functional tools for java
* everyday development -> who knows what I will need to learn, and a blog seems like a good place for making a notes
